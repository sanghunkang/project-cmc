#### Device Specifications
* CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700K CPU
* GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX1080 Ti 2x


Inspired by the two findings:
* Increased resolution contributes to the improvement on performance.
* Using cropped data contributes to the improvement of learning speed.

Samples of Cropped images

* The more cropped the data, the faster the learning rate. This observation can be ascribed to that the cropped images only contain partitions relevant to the classification.
* Although the learning rates differ by the amount of cropping, the final accuracies they converge don't show much difference
* It is quite sure that such problem is caused by pure computing issuses, e.g. NaN or zero division.


The learning curve with full image dataset reaches 1.0 , whereas that of 70% cropped dataset reaches only few times.

Worked quite well



## Suggestions

* Visualisation and quantification of activations with ZFNet, so that we can have firm evidence of benefit of having more focused dataset.
* It will also help us address the relation to the methodology with SVMs and the wavelet transformation.
* Utilising object detection algorithms
